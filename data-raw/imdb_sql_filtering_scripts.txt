Steps: 
3. Filter principles by in basic_filtered, called principles_filtered

Combine basic_filtered, episode_filtered, principles_filtered:
4. Associate all principles with episode primary title (unique), called principles_unique
5. Associate basic_filtered with principles_unique

Rename filtered tables as regular tables and remove old tables
